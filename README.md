# Problem Set Template Repository MECA 4107

This is the Template Repository for all of your problems sets.

The repo should contain at least 4 folders:

- `document`: contains your final document in `pdf` format. Ideally figures and tables should be pulled directly from the `views` folder. I've included a latex template I created last semester for the Thesis Seminar. 
- `scripts`: contains all your scripts
- `stores`: contains all the data sets used
- `views`: contains all figures and tables



## Some general reminders: 

- It is essential how you write up the document. Be sure to be organized and consistent in explaining your equations and findings. Make sure that there are no compilation errors.
- Write understandable code, separating and commenting on each section. Coding, like in writing, style is critical for readability. If the code is well written, it should be self-contained. There is no need to write everything you did. I encourage you to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
